## Testing 
The JSON-File _FileBuddyApiTests.postman_collection.json_ 
contains a test sequence mimicking a baisc workflow. 

In order for the script to work it needs to be imported into the _Postman_ application
and a file added as body value for the POST-request _upload-file_ (it is recommended to use the file _Test.txt_ provided above).
