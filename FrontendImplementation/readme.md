## Introduction
There are two user interfaces planned for the interaction with the API. At the current moment (2020-05-17) the first protoype for the desktop application is lauchned. This WPF (= Windows Presentation Foundation) application provides the registeration of user, as well as Mail+Password logging and basic file sharing.

For demo pruposes files are automatically shared with the sender.

## Basic application layout
By design, the main window is organized into two tabs *Received*, showing all files you are able to download with double click, and *Share*, which provides a drag-and-drop function to place the files you want to share.

Currently the received list must be updated manually (refresh button; top-right corner).
